<h1></strong>Laptop Price Prediction Project</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
This project aims to predict the price of laptops using machine learning techniques. By leveraging various features such as brand, specifications, and market trends, we've developed a model that can estimate the price of a laptop with reasonable accuracy.

<h2><strong>Dataset</strong></h2>
We've collected a comprehensive dataset comprising various attributes of laptops, including brand, processor type, RAM, storage, screen size, and other relevant specifications. This dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned to ensure quality and consistency in the training process.

<h2><strong>Machine Learning Approach</strong></h2>
We've employed a supervised learning approach, specifically regression techniques, to train our model. After splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, we experimented with different algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods to determine the most suitable model for our task.

<h2><strong>Evaluation Metrics</strong></h2>
To assess the performance of our models, we've utilized metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) score. These metrics provide insights into how well our model generalizes to unseen data and its ability to accurately predict laptop prices.
